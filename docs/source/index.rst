Ansible Documentation
=====================

Welcome to Ansible community documentation!
This documentation covers the version of Ansible noted in the upper left corner of this page.
We maintain multiple versions of Ansible and of the documentation, so please be sure you are using the version of the documentation that covers the version of Ansible you're using.
For recent features, we note the version of Ansible where the feature was added.

Ansible releases a new major release approximately twice a year.
The core application evolves somewhat conservatively, valuing simplicity in language design and setup.
Contributors develop and change modules and plugins, hosted in collections, much more quickly.
